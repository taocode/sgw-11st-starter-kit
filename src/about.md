<h2 id="why">OK, but why? <em>Really.</em> <a class="anchor" href="#why">{% icon "link" %}</a></h2>

Inspired by what we thought a *Surgeon General's Warning on Sugar* would look like, we based our statements off the Surgeon General's Warning printed on cigarrette packages added in 1984. This site and the resulting <a href="/downloads/sugar-general-warning-sheet-8bit.pdf">warning label sheet</a> were then produced. Please feel free to print out your own warning labels and stick them to packages of high sugar foods in your pantry or in your favorite store.

<h2 id="language">Blunt, Plain Language <a class="anchor" href="#blunt">{% icon "link" %}</a></h2>

Our warning uses plain, blunt language, certainly stronger than what a network news anchor would report. Network news agencies have a responsibility to their advertisers, we have a responsibility to our conscience. We stand by the dangers and complications of excess sugar consumption on your health. Learn more from our [resources page](/resources/), including links and common quantities of sugar for common foods.
